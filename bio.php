				<p class="lead">I believe there is a lot of untapped data out there, and I'd like to see what we can do with it.</p>
				<p class="lead">In college, I pursued a duel degree in mathematics and economics so I could quantitatively analyze the world we live in. In 2010, I leveraged my quantitative skills to become a programmer, first for a healthcare information system vendor, and now at Massachusetts General Hospital's Institute for Technology Assessment. I'm amazed by the rigid  attitude of most programmers. I find creativity is my biggest asset in my job.</p>
				<p class="lead">In 2009, congress passed the ARRA and HITECH acts. These acts laid the groundwork for digitalizing the healthcare system, as they created monetary incentives for hospitals to upgrade their information system (HCIS) to meet minimum requirements for data management. In 2010,  I started a job programming for a healthcare information system vendor. I was told on my first day that the healthcare industry is roughly 30 years behind on technology. Our first big project was releasing/supporting "the ARRA update", which met these minimum requirements for reimbursement from the government. In 2010, some hospitals were still using paper medical records, but I saw first-hand how much ARRA impacted the healthcare industry and helped us advance our healthcare system. It was clear this was the beginning of something big. (More about big data).</p>
				<p class="lead">In 2012, I joined a brilliant team of research at the Massachusetts General Hospital's Institute for Technology Assessment. These people were excited to utilize technology to create a more efficient healthcare system, In March 2013, we attended a lecture that was part of Harvard's Applied Statistics series. Alyssa Goodman, Professor of Astronomy, presented a research tool (Glue) that uses high-dimensional and linked view visualization in order to analyze the vast data sets of astronomical surveys. Our discussions surrounding the possibility of extending these tools to cancer research inspired me to broaden my knowledge of data science. Data analytics extends a technical skillset to practical application using statistics, analysis, creativity and visualization. I'm excited to use my skills to improve healthcare by exploiting data to find inefficiencies and discover actionable recommendations across the healthcare system. </p>
